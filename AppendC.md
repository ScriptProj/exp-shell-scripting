C4 网络资源  
1 Advanced Bash Scripting Guide (http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/). This is a
complete how-to shell-scripting guide that starts from the beginning and assumes
no previous expertise, and then works up to advanced scripting.  

2 An Introduction to the UNIX Shell (http://www.softlab.ece.ntua.gr/facilities/
documentation/unix/docs/sh.txt). I haven’t found an official bourne shell site, but
this is a good start. There are also plenty of other bourne shell programming guides
available. 

3 Heiner’s SHELLdorado—Your UNIX Shell Scripting Resource (http://www.shelldorado.
com). This site is an excellent resource for all sorts of shell-related topics. There are arti-
cles, best practices, tutorials, tips, scripts, and more.  


4 SysAdmin Magazine (http://www.samag.com). This publication does not focus specifi-
cally on shell scripting; it is mainly focused on system administration, but it usually has
some excellent shell-programming articles discussing useful procedures or problem
solutions.  

6 Usenet comp.unix.shell group (http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell).
Though not a web site, this resource is one of the best I have found relating to shell
scripting. It is a news discussion group that focuses on everything to do with shells.
There are incredibly talented people hanging out in this Usenet group who are willing
to answer your shell-related questions. There is also a vast amount of history that can
be searched and an FAQ maintained by the group’s members.
